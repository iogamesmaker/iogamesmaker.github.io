This program is not public

I respect people alting and don't want to ruin their fun
I know how it is being figured out by someone else for a dumb reason

pablo20 - Anubis or epig, can't remember (vencord, posted a ss accidentally)
Dutchman - Metalsnap (spying ):< )

So yeah it's not public. If you want me to track anything send me a DM and I'll probably do it if it's a decently engaging and quick to do.

If you want to buy it - send me a DM. I won't settle for low flux prices though. Wasted like 22 hours writing it.
It's really easy to use and I even added a "HELP" menu.
