<h3>My drednot.io stuff</h3>
<p>drednot.io is a fun io game go play it - this page is mainly useful for people that have played the game.</p>

<p>I just hole up a bunch of scripts / tools here - feel free to use or distribute them but please don't make a profit off them by selling them without adding any substantial features. Also - when selling please do give credit to this page BEFORE the transaction.</p>

    <p>This is more tricky to install, might need some of my help. DM @iogamesplayer if you get stuck.</p>
    <p>1: Install the Python 3.11 (or newer idk when you read this) package from the Microsoft Store.</p>
    <p>2: Download the script into your Downloads folder as "log.py".</p>
    <p>3: Open CMD, and type "cd Downloads".</p>
    <p>4: Run "python3 log.py" - it should return some errors. If the error is "Python3 is not recognized as a command", I don't really know how to fix that. Try installing the package from python.org AND MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THE ADD PYTHON TO $PATH CHECKBOX!!!</p>
    <p>5: All errors should be some imports missing, like "requests". Type "pip install XYZ" to install these</p>
    <p>6: Repeat that for every missing package, until it finally works.</p>
    <p>7: Wait like an hour for all the data to download. Read the help menu or something. It's ~1.5GB and should only download once.</p>
