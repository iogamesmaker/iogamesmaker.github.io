<h1>GPU accelerated black hole renderer</h1>
<p>Like 1.5 years ago I started on a project called <a href="https://iogamesplayer.com/projects/blackholerenderer/">Black Hole Renderer</a>, and it was pretty good, except that it was slow as fuck.</p>

<p>so, I fixed that with this new thing. I used the same """engine""" as the raymarched landscape, and just modified the shader. I should've made this on shadertoy but whatever. It's basically just the same. One thing I did fix though is the camera rotation BS which made the first version look all warped when rotating.</p>
