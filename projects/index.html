<p>I get bored a lot and when I want to waste time on the computer and I am not feeling like doing something productive, I turn to .io games, hence my name. Finding .io games is another story. When you google ".io games" you get shitty websites that advertise the paying games in front of the better ones.</p>

<h3>An unnamed WIP project</h3>
<p>Once upon a time I stumbled down another programming rabbit hole, the modern OpenGL rabbithole. I started out following someone's tutorial about using GLAD + SDL2 and in around 4 hours I got myself a triangle! I wanted to continue but sadly the tutorial didn't continue on for long. I found another place where I could learn this dark art: <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">Learn OpenGL</a>. Now I've been kind-of following along loosely, skipping some chapters, doing an intermezzo of wasting my time trying stupid stuff, you know the rime.</p>
<p>Right now I'm trying to add a skybox, but have some plans I probably won't or can't realise. My end goal of this project is to create a game-ish thing people can play, much like Quake. When I finished the Learn OpenGL course I'll try to add a saving system, a level editor, and stuff I'm going to figure out later. I have one goal, to make the game <i>fun</i> to play. It doesn't have to look good, it has to <i>feel</i> good aswell. But yeah, modern OpenGL is weird, hard, random, and probably going to be defeated by Vulkan. I am not at all convinced I can finish this massive project without losing motivation, or dying in the process.</p>
