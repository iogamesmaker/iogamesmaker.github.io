<h1>My stupid site</h1>
<p>Hi nonexistant internetscreen people! I am a kid that just discovered Github sites! Exiting!</p>Well, you probably didn't ask but I'm going to tell anyways. - "How did you come by such a stupid name? You were better off with the automatically-generated Kahoot names!" - Well, after my stupidly genereric name "Speedy" was taken when I attempted to make a Scratch account. I had a moment of reality coming into my nostrils. "Oh no", I said. "This super-original, one-of-a-kind username, my child, SOMEONE STOLE IT!". But of course, I had to make a Scratch account because I needed to hack into the blockchain servers of Joe Biden or something like that. I asked myself "What do I do all day. What could be an unique username, instantly recognizable yet very unique with amazing depth?" I instantly knew the response. "iogamesplayer".</p>Now, for some reason, no other child had taken this gorgeous name earlier than me. I had discovered true treasure. An untaken username, original and pronouncable but still memorable. Some time after that, I almost changed my username to "xXanonymousXx" for some stupid reason, thank god someone in the Minecraft server stopped me from making that choice. Now that I'm on the cool coding site I had to make some adjustments (and not because iogamesplayer was taken by another unfathomable loser, and not even in use), so iogamesmaker it was.</p></p>You can find me on most dumb platforms I'm on as iogamesplayer. Scratch, some .io games, Discord, YouTube (don't go there), and Steam (iogamesplayer_) just to name a few.
