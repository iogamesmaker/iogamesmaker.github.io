<h1>My stupid site</h1>
<p>Hi nonexistant internetscreen people! I am a kid that just discovered Github sites! Exiting!</p>Well, you probably didn't ask but I am gonna tell anyways - "How did you come by such a stupid name? You were better off with the automatically-generated Kahoot names!" - Well, after my stupidly genereric name "Speedy" was taken when I made a Scratch account, I had a moment of reality coming into my nostrils. "Oh no", I said. "This super-original, one-of-a-kind username, my child, SOMEONE ELSE STOLE IT!". But of course, I had to make a Scratch account because I needed to hack into the blockchain servers of Joe Biden or something like that. I asked myself "What do I do all day. What would be an unique username, instantly recognizable yet infinitely unique with such depth?" I instantly knew the response. "iogamesplayer".</p>Now, for some reason, no single other child had taken this gorgeous name earlier than me. I had discovered true treasure. An untaken username, original and pronouncable but still memorable. Some time after that, I almost changed my username to "xXanonymousXx" for some stupid reason, thank god someone in the Minecraft server stopped me from making that choice. Anyways, now that I am on the cool coding site I had to make some adjustments (and not because iogamesplayer was taken by another unfathomable loser).</p>
