<h1>My stupid site</h1>
<p>Hi nonexistant internetscreen people! I am a kid that just discovered Github sites! Exiting!</p>Well, you probably didn't ask but I'm going to tell anyways. - "How did you come by such a stupid name? You were better off with the automatically-generated Kahoot names!" - Well, after my stupidly genereric name "Speedy" was taken when I attempted to make a Scratch account I had a moment of reality coming into my nostrils. "Oh no", I said. "This super-original, one-of-a-kind username, my child, SOMEONE STOLE IT!". But of course, I had to make a Scratch account because I needed to hack into the blockchain servers of Joe Biden or something like that. I asked myself "What do I do all day. What could be an unique username, instantly recognizable yet very unique with amazing depth?" I instantly knew the response. "iogamesplayer".</p>Now, for some reason, no other child had taken this gorgeous name earlier than me. I had discovered true treasure. An untaken username, original and pronouncable but still memorable. Some time after that, I almost changed my username to "xXanonymousXx" for some stupid reason, thank god someone in the Minecraft server stopped me from making that choice. Now that I'm on the cool coding site I had to make some adjustments (and not because iogamesplayer was taken by another unfathomable loser, and not even in use), so iogamesmaker it was.</p>You can find me on most dumb platforms I'm on as iogamesplayer. Scratch, some .io games, Discord, YouTube (don't go there), and Steam (iogamesplayer_) just to name a few.</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>School ðŸ¤®</h3>
<p1>I started coding in C++ for a school project in October 2022. We didn't utilise the ++ part, it was basically a C text adventure, not really exciting.</p>Before that, I had only coded in Scratch, so I didn't know anything. After the project was over, we got a 60% on it. The teacher that graded the exam clearly didn't know much about programming, and complained we spend too much time making the program, and not researching C++? Thank god one of our members didn't do shit, so me and my friend got slightly higher grades. When it was time to present it we got mostly positive reactions from the other parents, the other kid that did something made Tic-Tac-Toe with an input system that worked, but did nothing more. I felt like that was one of the projects that taught me more. Source code for the text adventure and tic-tac-toe is <a href="https://github.com/iogamesmaker/oldprojects">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Other stuff</h3>
<p1>When it was around Juli 2023 - 6 months year later -, I started following C++ tutorials by 3DSage, it worked out decently other than that it had a horrible bug which I couldn't fix. After a way too short amount of time I decided to move on and give up. Around this time I also became interested in Linux, the superior OS, because on Windows you couldn't possibly compile code, it seems.</p1>
<h3>the Mandelbrot Set</h3>
<p1>In late Juli I was searching again for something to pass time, when I came across this interesting video explaining the Mandelbrot set, and of course I asked chatGPT to create a C++ program plotting the Mandelbrot set, because that is the only language I know. A couple of them programs worked, but it didn't really feel accomplishing. Some more weeks passed and I found a wikipedia article with some pseudo-code I could convert to C++! (C again because I wasn't using any ++ features :P.)</p1>
